# Jankson

Welcome to the Jankson wiki.

## What is Jankson?

Jankson is a [JSON5] / [HJSON] parser and preprocessor that preserves ordering and comments.

## Where do I get it?

**Users:** Jankson should have been included with your program.
If you need a copy, you can find the latest [releases on GitHub].

**Developers:** To get started using Jankson, head over to the [Getting Started] page.

## How is it different from other JSON libraries?

Jankson supports a list of "[quirks]" that extend the JSON format,
such as comments and unquoted keys.

These quirks mostly come from the [JSON5] and [HJSON] specifications.
